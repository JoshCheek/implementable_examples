Implement React
===============

Taken from [here](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gWWZgR), suggested by Matt Larraz
in response to [this](https://twitter.com/josh_cheek/status/894045555617345536)
request.

To run:

```sh
$ ruby -run -ehttpd . -p8000
```

Then open your browser to port 8000 to see that the example is failing.

Then edit `implementation.js` until the example passes.
