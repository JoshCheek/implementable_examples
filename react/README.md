Implement React
===============

You can see how it should work by looking at how it runs when it uses React, [here](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gWWZgR).
Suggested by Matt Larraz in response to [this](https://twitter.com/josh_cheek/status/894045555617345536) request.
Uses [Babel Standalone](https://github.com/babel/babel-standalone) to transform the JSX.

To run:

```sh
$ ruby -run -ehttpd . -p8000
```

Then open your browser to port 8000 to see that the example is failing.

Then edit `implementation.js` until the example passes.
